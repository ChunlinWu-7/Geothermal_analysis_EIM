# Geothermal engineering -- spherical water tanks under time-harmonic heat transfer

## Description
This software package serves as supplemental information for Reviewers to review/verify results/figures/findings in the manuscript "The Green's Function Based Analysis for Seasonal Heat Storage and Utilization in a Solar-Geothermal Building". 

This software package is not open-access currently, which will be available after acceptance of the above manuscript. 

## Supplemental library
Eigen-3.4.0 and boost library are applied to conduct analysis. 

Please install these two libraries before compiling the code. 

## In/Output files:
(1) particle.txt: specify number of water tanks; positions of tanks; effective thermal conductivity; effective heat capacity; 

(2) post_temp.txt: postprocess temperature; 

(3) post_flux.txt: postprocess heat flux;
